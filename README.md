Beezniss is a single-page business dashboard built with React and Node/Express/MySQL, incorporating many components of utility to businesses and their employees, including a task manager, a sales forecaster, a marketing performance grapher, live messaging, a social media feed, & videoconferencing capability.

## the build
I (Ehler) built this app along with 4 team members.  

As the lead developer and chief contributor, I worked on most facets of the app, 
but I _alone_ **built**
* the **backend**, including db models, routes, and controllers
* the **Task Manager component** _(Ã  la Trello / Jira)_, including frontend in React/SemanticUI
